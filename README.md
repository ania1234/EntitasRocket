WARNING: this is still a work in progress, converted from a very old, poorly written project. There is still a lot to do:

- pooling for game objects!!!
- introduce scriptable objects instead of magical constants in Constants class
- code cleanup
- game crash on last level
- adding back in invincibility period after colliding with red asteroid
